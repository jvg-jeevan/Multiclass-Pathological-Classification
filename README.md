# Multiclass-Pathological-Classification
This project classifies pathological voice signals using deep learning and machine learning models. It analyzes healthy and pathological voices (hyperkinetic dysphonia, hypokinetic dysphonia, reflux laryngitis) using MFCC features. Models include SVM, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression, with performance evaluated using accuracy and F1-score.
